**Automated Damage Assessment (ADA)** provides **geographic hazard and building damage information** to support disaster response and recovery efforts.â€¨Its primary purpose is to **visualize building damage data on an interactive map**, alongside **population information** for impact awareness.

Data in ADA is grouped by **events** and further sub-grouped by **administrative boundaries** to help users quickly understand the geographic impact.
ADA currently supports damage assessments for the following hazards:

1. Tropical Cyclone
2. Conflict
3. Volcanic Eruption
4. Earthquake
5. Fire
6. Flood
7. Heavy Rain
8. Landslide
9. Tsunami

All presented data is **derived from remote sensing, automated survey techniques, and forecasting models**.

ADA is developed and maintained by [The Netherlands Red Cross](https://redcross.nl) under the open-source [MIT license](https://github.com/rodekruis/ADA-API/blob/main/LICENSE). For questions or technical support, contact us at [dev@510.global](mailto:dev@510.global).
